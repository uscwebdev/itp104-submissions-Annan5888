            <div id="P">
                <p> Wenzhou, historically known as Wenchow is a prefecture-level city in China's Zhejiang province.
                    Wenzhou is located at the extreme southeast
                    of Zhejiang, bordering Lishui to the west, Taizhou to the north, and the province of Fujian to
                    the south. The area consists of mostly mountainous terrain, as well as hundreds of islands off
                    the East China Sea coast, which is nearly 355 kilometres (221 miles) in length. It is said that
                    the city's land is 70% mountains, 20% farmland, and 10% water. At the time of the 2010
                    Chinese census, 3,039,500 people lived in Wenzhou's urban area.The greater Wenzhou
                    prefecture, which also includes three satellite cities and six counties, had a population
                    totalling 9,122,100, of which 31.16% are residents originally from outside of Wenzhou.</p>

                <p> During the 19th century, the progenitor city of modern Wenzhou was known as Yungkia (Chinese:
                    永嘉,
                    Yǒngjiā),a prosperous foreign treaty port that remains well-preserved today. Being situated
                    in the mountains, it has been isolated for most of its history from the rest of the country,
                    making its local culture and language particularly distinct, even from its direct neighbours.
                    The city is also the native land of many emigrants to Europe and the United States, with many
                    Wenzhounese immigrants abroad becoming entrepreneurs, restaurantiers, and retail and wholesale
                    businesspeople in their adopted countries. Wenzhou people make up a large proportion of the
                    Chinese residents in Italy, consituting approximately 90% of Tuscany's Chinese population.
                    Significant concentrations of Wenzhounese also live in New York City, as well as across France
                    and Spain.</p>

                <p> Under Wenzhou's jurisdiction, there are two cities (Rui'an City and Yue'qing City), three districts
                    and six counties with a total land area of 11,784 square kilometers. Among its 7.64 million (2007)
                    inhabitants, about 1.5 million live in urban area. Wenzhou got its name for its mild climate (wen
                    means "temperate" in Chinese). Wenzhou has favorable
                    natural conditions, being either too hot in summer nor too cold in winter, with four distinct
                    seasons.The Wenzhou city also rich in tourism resources, with two national scenic areas and two
                    national nature reserve.
